# ngwp-cli
Angular2+ CLI and starter files with Typescript, Sass, Karma, Jasmine, and Webpack 2 bundling.

## Overview
The ngwp CLI is designed to make Angular development with Webpack easy and fast. Use the CLI to generate a new project, then use generator commands to quickly add components, directives, pipes, models, services, and routes.

## Installation
First, download the NPM module by installing it globally. The global install will enable you to access the ngwp command without installing it locally.

```
$ npm install ngwp-cli -g
```
Check the version to confirm the installation.

```
Use the --help command to view your options.
