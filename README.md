# ngwp-cli
Angular2+ CLI and starter files with Typescript, Sass, Karma, Jasmine, and Webpack 2 bundling.

## Overview
The ngwp CLI is designed to make Angular development with Webpack easy and fast. Use the CLI to generate a new project, then use generator commands to quickly add components, directives, pipes, models, services, and routes.

## Installation
First, clone the repo to your local drive. Then, cd into the ngwp-cli directory and install the CLI globally. This approach will enable you to modify the template files as needed, while using the CLI across projects.

```
$ cd Desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/dcarrsf/ngwp-cli.git
$ cd ngwp-cli
$ npm install -g
```
Check the version to confirm the installation.
```
$ ngwp -V
```
Use the --help command to view your options.
```
$ ngwp --help
```
